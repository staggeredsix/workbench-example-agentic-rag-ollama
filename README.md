# Agentic RAG - Web Search with Accuracy and Hallucination Controls

### Boost RAG with an Agentic Layer
- **Route**: Checks the RAG context for relevance to the query and adds live web search if the context is thin
- **Evaluate**: Checks responses for relevance and accuracy, flags hallucinations
- **Iterate**: Goes through multiple evaluation and generation cycles

### Modify Agentic RAG
- **Edit Prompts**: Customize results through your own prompts
- **Change Parameters**: Adjust agent behavior through parameters and runtime variables
- **Look and Feel**: Change the agent and UI by editing the code yourself

### Inference Your Way

- **Self-Hosted (default)**: Point to Ollama on your own GPUs
- **Free Endpoints**: optionally use free endpoints on build.nvidia.com


## Get Started 

#### This README has three modes:
- **Easy Mode**: Use the application
- **Intermediate Mode**: Modify the application
- **Advanced Mode**: Self-host gpus for inference

### Prerequisites - AI Workbench and an Internet Connection

> You can run Agentic RAG without Workbench, but this README requires [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/) installed.
> See [how to install it here](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/installation/overview.html).

> You need internet because Agentic RAG uses an NVIDIA endpoint for document embedding.

### Easy Mode (< 5 minutes if Workbench installed)
1. Get NVIDIA and Tavily API keys:  
   - ``NVIDIA_API_KEY`` → [Generate](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-keys)  See instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/deployment/spark-rapids-accelerator/latest/appendix-ngc.html).
   - ``TAVILY_API_KEY`` → [Generate](https://tavily.com)  
2. **Clone** this repo with AI Workbench > [configure the keys](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/environment/variables.html#basic-usage-for-environment-variables) when prompted.  
3. Click **Open Chat** > Go to the **Document** tab in the web app > Click **Add to Context**.  
4. Type in your question > Hit enter - answers come from your local Ollama model.

### Clone Project > Start Chat >  Create Context >  Ask Questions


| Steps | What can go wrong | Screen shot |
|------|--------------------|-------------|
| 1. Open the Desktop App > Select [local](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/locations/locations.html). | Probably a  Docker Desktop issue (if selected on install). **Fix**:  See [troubleshooting here](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html) | <p align="center"><img src="./data/readme-images/desktop-icon.png" width="120" alt="Desktop App Icon"></p> |
| 2. Click **Clone Project** > Paste repository [URL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/workbench-example-agentic-rag) > **Clone** | Incorrect URL. **Fix**: use the correct URL. | <img src="./data/readme-images/clone-button.png" width="250" height="auto" alt="Clone Button"> |
| 3. Click **Resolve Now** > Enter NVIDIA and Tavily API keys. | You don't see the banner. **Fix**: go to **Project Container > Variables > Configure** for API keys. See [docs here](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/environment/variables.html) | <img src="./data/readme-images/resolve-now.png" width="200" height="auto" alt="Resolve Now Warning"> |
| 4. Click **Open Chat**. | Very little can go wrong here | <img src="./data/readme-images/open-chat-screen-shot.png" width="250" height="auto" alt="Open Chat Button"> |
| 5. Click **Documents > Create Context**. | Incorrect API key. Fix per Step 3 above. | <img src="./data/readme-images/add-to-context-button.png" width="300" height="auto" alt="Add to Context Button"> |
| 6. Type question > Hit  enter. |  Incorrect API key. Fix per Step 3 above. | <img src="./data/readme-images/hit-enter.png" width="200" height="auto" alt="Chat Text"> |

### Clear Context > Change URLs > Create Context  > Ask Questions

Use these steps when you want to work with your own documents and your own prompts.

| Steps | What can go wrong | Screen shot | 
|------|--------------------|-------------|
| 1. Click **Documents > Clear Context**. | Very little. | Vector DB reset. |
| 2. Delete the URLs > Add your own > Click **Add to Context**. |   URLs that can't be resolved. **Fix**: Enter appropriate URLs | New context. |
| 3. Type question > Hit enter. |  Incorrect API key. **Fix**: Fix per Step 3 in table above. | Triggers the agent. |

## Intermediate Mode

#### See [Full Intermediate Mode Instructions Here](agentic-rag-docs/intermediate-edit-code.md)

This application is a quick prototype and not a robust piece of software. So there are **many** opportunities to improve it.

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this project to your own GitHub account. Then clone it in Workbench
2. [Add VS Code to the project](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/applications/vs-code.html)
3. Create an ``experiment`` branch to protect main
4. Open VS Code from the Desktop App and edit the application code
   - Change recursion limit, number of web sites returned by Tavily, whether previous searches are saved
   - Add new endpoints from build.nvidia.com
   - Change the look and feel of the Gradio app or add new features
   - Modify the agent
   - Fix any bugs you find

## Advanced Mode
### See [Full Advanced Mode Instructions Here](agentic-rag-docs/self-host.md).
Use these details if you want to modify the application, e.g. by configuring prompts, adding your own endpoints, changing the Gradio app or whatever else occurs to you.

1. Set up a Linux box with an NVIDIA GPU and Docker.  
2. Deploy an Ollama container on that host.
3. Configure the chat app to use the self-hosted endpoint.
